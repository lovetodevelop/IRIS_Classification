# IRIS_Classification
A fundamental stepping point to deep neural network is the "Hello World" of machine learning, the IRIS classification problem. 

# Approach
1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocessing 
3. Building model
4. Evaluation of model

# Libraries Used
- Tensorflow (for machine learning)
- Pandas (for data analysis and manipulation)
- Numpy (for numerical computation and assisting Tensorflow)
